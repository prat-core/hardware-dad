Test Message: Create a simple LED circuit with a red LED connected to pin 13
==================================================

Agent Response:
The circuit is now complete! This is a basic LED circuit where:
1. The red LED's anode (positive leg) is connected to digital pin 13 of the Arduino
2. The LED's cathode (negative leg) is connected to ground (GND)
3. When pin 13 is set HIGH in your Arduino code, the LED will light up
4. When pin 13 is set LOW, the LED will turn off

Pin 13 is commonly used for LED circuits because:
- It has a built-in resistor on most Arduino boards
- It's connected to the onboard LED on most Arduino boards
- It's often used for the "Blink" example sketch

You can now upload code to make the LED blink or respond to various conditions as needed!
